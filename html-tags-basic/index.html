    <!--This is the structure of a comment block in html files
        everything in this structure is NOT considered part of any
        content of your webpage

        Most tage elements in html are done in pairs
        These are called opening and closing pairs
        The opening tag indicates the element being requested
        The closing tag indicates the element is complete
        The closing tag has the same name as the opening tag PLUS
            a slash (/) preceding the name

        Normally, you will specify the language of the code on the we page
        Use the lang element parameter to specify your coding language

        <h3>Paragraph Tag</h3>
        <!--This is the coding block for your content in a paragraph tag.
            A paragraph tag belongs to the "block" group of tags.
            "block" group of tags place your content on a new line.-->
        <p>
            The paragraph tag is a block tag. A block tag begins a new line in your 
            displayed web page on the browser. The browser does NOT display your content 
            in the physical style of how you have entered your code in your html file.

            This is my second paragaph on the displayed browser page. It will start a new 
            line.

        <!--If you wish to use a component of a reserved tag(or the whole tag) you would in 
            trouble using the tag.
            Instead you can use special character strings to represent components of the tag
            such as the < (&lt;) and the > (&gt;) symbols-->

        <h3>Anchor tag</h3>
        <!-- This is an anchor tag and is incorrectly often referred to as the link tag
             One should NOT use the link tage because there is actually a <link> tag
             used in the <head> section.
            This tag can tage you to adifferent location whether it be a different website,
            different page in the current web site, or a different position on the current
            page.
            
            Paramenters:
                href: points to the desired location
                target: indicates the browser display option
                        default is same display page
                        _blank will open a new browser tab(page)
